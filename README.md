# AirRnR (A Clone of AirBnB)

## Link to live site: 

https://lek-airbnb.onrender.com


## Description:

This site clones a couple of AirBnb features including the CRUD for spots and reviews. On this site, you can add spots for users to rent and write reviews of those spots. If you're not logged in as a user, all you can do is look at all the spots and reviews without posting or reviewing yourself. 


## Technologies Used:

1. Express 
2. Sequelize
3. React
4. Redux
5. Javascript


## Future Features:

I am hoping to implement a feature for bookings in the future so users can actually book a spot.


## Setting up this repo locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run 'npm start' in both the backend and frontend folders. 
3. The site should open on your local server!
